keep all these files and folder in same directory
use the datafiles I have given you.

starting from scratch.....
1.Run data_extract.py(using python3)// it will take atleast 12 to 24 hours for execution
2.Run convert.py
3.Run Final.R(using Rstudio... dont forget to set path while running the code)
4.Run model.py

warning on model.py:
while running svm part comment gbm
and do viceversa for faster execution


PS: Run the R code to generate as many plots as you want.
